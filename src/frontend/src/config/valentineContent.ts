4 years ago you came into my life as an angle and now I want to marry that angle.

I give this to you as a letter from my heart. Every moment with you is a treasure, and I wanted to create something special just for you.

You light up my world in ways words can't fully express. This Valentine's Day, I want you to know how much you mean to me.

With all my love,
Forever yours ♥`;
