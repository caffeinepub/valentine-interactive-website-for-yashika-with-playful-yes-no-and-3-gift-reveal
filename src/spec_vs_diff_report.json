  "summary": "Diff suggests Gift 2 photo filenames and the three required JPEG assets were added/updated, plus SafeGeneratedImage usage and deployment helper docs/scripts. However, the diff summary does not provide concrete evidence that Gift 2 is driven *only* by HER_PHOTOS in the exact required order, that all placeholder references for Gift 2 were removed, or that redeploy/live URL validation occurred.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Ensure Gift 2 (\"Beautiful You\") displays only the user-provided 3 photos driven by HER_PHOTOS from frontend/src/config/valentineContent.ts, and that HER_PHOTOS is exactly ['IMG_0131-1.jpeg','IMG_4617-1.jpeg','IMG_0156-1.jpeg'] in that order; no placeholder filename references used for Gift 2 anywhere.",
      "reason": "The diff summary mentions valentineContent.ts includes the three photos, but does not show the actual HER_PHOTOS array contents/order, nor does it show removal of any placeholder filename references or how Gift 2 consumes the config.",

      "reason": "Presence of the three files is evidenced, but the diff summary cannot confirm that the deployed site serves them at the specified URLs (no build output/hosting config evidence) or that Gift 2 no longer triggers the fallback state.",
