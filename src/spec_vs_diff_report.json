  "summary": "The diff adds an in-app help entry point on the Gifts screen via a dialog and introduces a SafeGeneratedImage component to provide graceful fallbacks for missing/broken images. However, due to truncation of GiftsScreen.tsx, some REQ-12 instruction details cannot be fully verified, and the fallback text formatting does not exactly match the example “Image not found: <filename>”.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Help instructions explicitly mention the config file and fields to edit: frontend/src/config/valentineContent.ts (HER_PHOTOS, COUPLE_PHOTOS, FINAL_COUPLE_PHOTO).",
      "reason": "The GiftsScreen help dialog content is truncated before showing the referenced config file path and specific fields, so this cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Help instructions explicitly state that the app reads images from /assets/generated/<filename> (and to use exact filenames including extensions).",
      "reason": "The dialog shows the folder path and mentions exact filenames, but the portion that would confirm an explicit statement about the runtime path pattern “/assets/generated/<filename>” is not visible due to truncation.",

      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Fallback message for missing images should be an English message like “Image not found: <filename>”.",
      "reason": "SafeGeneratedImage renders “Image not found” and then renders the filename on a separate line, rather than a single message in the form “Image not found: <filename>”. This may not meet the stated acceptance criteria phrasing.",
