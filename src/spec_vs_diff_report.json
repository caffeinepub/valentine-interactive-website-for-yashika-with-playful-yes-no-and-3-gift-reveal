There is no evidence in the diff that the required Gift 2 photo assets were added at the exact public paths, nor that valentineContent.ts was updated to use exactly the required HER_PHOTOS filenames/order. Live redeploy/validation (REQ-24) cannot be confirmed from this diff.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, and none of the required image paths appear as created/modified assets in the diff. Therefore there is no evidence the three JPEGs were added under frontend/public/assets/generated/.",

      "reason": "No diff content for frontend/src/config/valentineContent.ts is shown; only a separate summary file mentions it. Without an actual change to valentineContent.ts in the diff, there is no evidence HER_PHOTOS was verified/updated as required.",
      "evidence": [
